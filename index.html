				<h1>Hey There!</h1>
				<p> I`m Tim Portnoy, student for Integrated Design BA in Dessau, Germany.  </p>
				<p> I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and currently, 26 years old.  </p>
				<p> I specialize in Graphic Design, Typography, 3D and combining them all together into a coherent, sleek design.  </p>
				<p> My interdisciplinary studies aid me not just in understanding the different fields of design but also in taking ideas from unexpected places.  </p>
				<p> The two bauhaus cities influence my designs and typography and I am motivated to revitalize and modernize the international style but be adventorous enough to distrupt and deconstruct the style and concenzus surrounding it.  </p>
				<p> I wish to push the envelope with my hebrew typography and excite with fresh new ideas </p>

				<p> Jiggle offers a fun and sustainable way to taste the future of food. </p>
				<p> Packed with complete proteins, Vitamin B12 and prebiotics, Jiggle gives you a lot more than the average protein bar. </p>
				<p> For centuries, people around the world have eaten insects as part of their normal diet. One of the most promising species is the mealworm. Mealworms are packed with important nutrients and protein, and they're much more environmentally sustainable than meat. </p>
